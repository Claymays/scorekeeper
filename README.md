# Clayton Mays Individual Project

### Problem Statement
I regularly find myself in a position where I need something to track numbers in a game. Whether it's being caught out at a bar and playing cards with friends, or trying to keep the numbers right on a running bet between a dozen people. Every phone comes equipped with a notes app, but the formatting is often more tedious than it's worth.
My app will facilitate score keeping, with easy to define teams of multiple named players. It will also track the number of times a given person has won, or lost, and potentially even allow for deep analytics on recorded games.
